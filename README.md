# bmp2bytes

Converts 1-bit monochrome bitmap image (BMP format) to string
and outputs it to `stdout`. Where data is require as text input.

Used in Arduino project with [TVOut library](https://github.com/Avamander/arduino-tvout).

This is version 2.

To get legacy version 1 check out [v1-legacy](https://github.com/dknight/bmp2bytes/tree/v1-legacy) branch.

## Install

```sh
make build
```

## Usage

```
bmp2tpues [-mrihfd] <file.bmp>
```
- **-h**: Prints usage;
- **-r**: reverse rows;
- **-i**: invert image bits;
- **-m**: prints meta data of the image and exit;
- **-f** <string>: format of the output, any number qualifier for `printf` function is accepted. Examples: %d, %X, %02X, etc. Default: 0x%02X;
- **-d**: delimiter of the output. Default: "," (comma).
