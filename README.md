# bmp2bytes

Converts 1-bit bitmap image (BMP format) to C byte array.

Probably goint to use this for next Arduino project with [TVOut library](https://github.com/Avamander/arduino-tvout).

## Usage

```
bmp2bytes <filename> [r [i]]
```

* Eg1. bmp2bytes test16x16.bmp r i
* Eg2. bmp2bytes test16x16.bmp r
* Eg3. bmp2bytes test16x16.bmp

**r** - reverse rows<br>
**i** - invert image<br>
**r** and **i** argument can be any values except NULL.

### Image
![Test Bitmap](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dknight/bmp2bytes/master/test_girl.bmp)

### Output
